In the fall of 1951, [Will Burtin][burtin] published this graph showing the effectiveness of three popular antibiotics on 16 different bacteria, measured in terms of [minimum inhibitory concentration][mic].

This is a D3 version of [@mbostock][mbostock]’s [orignal Protovis remake][pv]. The source comments are his. Some minor details have been changed to match the [original design][original] more closely.
